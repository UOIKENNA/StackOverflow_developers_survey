# Installation
The code should run without issues using Python 3.*. All the necessary libraries were imported using the Anaconda distribution.

# Project Motivation

I looked at the [Stack Overflow Developers Survey 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) data set and I decided to find out more information about developers living in Nigeria. The questions I sought answers to were related to their choice of education, level of education, job satisfaction and career satisfaction.

# File Descriptions

There is one jupyter notebook available here to showcase the work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in explaining the individual steps.

# Results
The results of this analysis are available on a medium post [here](https://uikenna97.medium.com/a-survey-on-developers-in-nigeria-f7f1380f61ff)

# Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgements

Credit to Stack Overflow for the data I used. I also credit https://github.com/iris-theof/developers_survey for providing me with guidance to perform this project. The code in this repository can be viewed and inputs will be welcome!.
